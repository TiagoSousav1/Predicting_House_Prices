This repository was created for storage purposes, the original project was developed used google's collab. This project was developed for the course of Machine Learning, in the context of the Master's in Eletrical and Computer Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering of the Univeristy of Porto. Furthermore, this project was done with [the dataset provided in kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
